#' @description
#' \code{get.nearest} returns the distance from each point in a set to the nearest of a second set of points (by lat/lon).
#' 
#' @details
#' This function returns a vector of distances, 
#' which are the distances from one set of points to the nearest single member (if any) of another set of points.
#' Points are specified using latitude and longitude in decimal degrees.
#' Relies on the \pkg{sp} package for the \code{\link[sp]{spDists}} and \code{\link[sp]{SpatialPoints}} functions.
#' \cr\cr
#' A future version may use get.distances.all() but for performance only use it for distance pairs (pairs of points) that have been initially 
#' quickly filtered using lat/lon to be not too far, in an attempt to go much faster in an initial pass.
#' *** get.nearest with loops takes 42 seconds vs 3 seconds for this version, for 100k frompoints and 100 topoints:  Sys.time(); x=get.nearest2(t100k, t100); Sys.time()
#' > Sys.time(); x=get.nearest2(testpoints(1e6), testpoints(100)); Sys.time()
#' [1] 14:33:05 EDT
#' [1] 14:33:33 EDT  <30 seconds from 1 mill to 100 points, as in finding nearest of 100 sites for 9% of the US Census blocks.
#' But R hung/crashed on 11mill frompoints -- Probably out of memory. *** Need to break it up into batches of maybe 1 to 100 million distances at a time? 
#' There are 11,078,297 blocks according to \url{http://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/tallies/national_geo_tallies.html}
#' 
#' @param frompoints A matrix or data.frame with two cols, 'lat' and 'lon' (or only 2 cols that are lat and lon in that order) with datum=WGS84 assumed.
#' @param topoints A matrix or data.frame with two cols, 'lat' and 'lon' (or only 2 cols that are lat and lon in that order) with datum=WGS84 assumed.
#' @param ignore0 A logical, default is FALSE, specifying whether to ignore distances that are zero and report only the minimum nonzero distance. 
#'   Useful if nearest point other than self, where frompoints=topoints, for example.
#' @param return.rownums Logical value, TRUE by default. If TRUE, value returned also includes these 2 columns:
#'   a col named fromrow of index numbers starting at 1 specifying the frompoint and a similar col named n specifying the row of the nearest topoint.
#' @param return.latlons Logical value, FALSE by default. If TRUE, value returned also includes four extra columns,
#'   showing fromlat, fromlon, tolat, tolon.
#' @param units A string that is 'miles' by default, or 'km' for kilometers, specifying units for distances returned.
#' @return By default, returns a vector of distances, but can return a matrix of numbers, with columns that can include fromrow and torow indexing 
#'   which is nearest (first if >1 match) of topoints, fromlat, fromlon, tolat, tolon, and d (distance).
#'   Distance returned is in miles by default, but with option to set units='km' to get kilometers.
#'   See parameters for details on other formats that may be returned if specified.
#' @seealso \code{\link{get.distances}} which gets distances between all points (within an optional search radius),
#'   \code{\link{get.distances.all}} which allows you to get distances between all points,
#'   \code{\link{get.distances.prepaired}} for finding distances when data are already formatted as pairs of points, and
#'   \code{\link{proxistat}} which calculates a proximity score for each spatial unit based on distances to nearby points.

  #frompoints and topoints each must be a matrix with 'lat' and 'lon' colnames (or only 2 cols that are lat and lon in that order)
  
  # ***** Notes on performance/ speed: ******
  # It should be easy to speed this up (for very large numbers of topoints) by using a box to search within (as get.distances does) and only enlarge the search box if no topoints are found in it.
  # One could assume topoints are uniformly distributed in extent defined by range(c(frompoints$lat, topoints$lat)) and range(c(frompoints$lon, topoints$lon))
  # Then do initial search for nearest by using get.distances(frompoints, topoints, max.miles=x) 
  # where max.miles is chosen so there is a 95% chance that at least one topoint will be within max.miles ***
  # *** BUT doesn't that assume frompoint is in the center of all the topoints? and that box is close to square not long rectangle?
  # So full extent of A sqkm for N topoints means avg of N/A topoints per sqkm, or A/N sqkms have 1 topoint on avg, and 
  # Each of N topoints has box/A chance of being in box, and 
  # chance of at least one being in box is 1-(1-box/A)^N = 0.95, so box/A= 1 - (1-0.95)^(1/N)
