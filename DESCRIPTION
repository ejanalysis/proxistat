Package: proxistat
Title: Create a Proximity Score in Each Census Unit, Based on Distances to
    Specified Points
Version: 1.0.0
Date: 2020-01-01
Description: This package has functions helping to calculate distances between
    geographic points, such as the distances between all points, distances to
    all points within some maximum distance, distance to nearest single point,
    etc. It also can create a proximity score for each spatial unit like a Census
    block group, to quantify the distance-weighted count of nearby points. This
    proximity score can be used in environmental justice (EJ) analysis, for example.
    This package uses the sp package for the basic distance calculation.
    Key functions include get.nearest() to find the one topoint nearest each frompoint,
    get.distances() to find distances quickly within an optional search radius, and
    get.distances.all() to find distances from all frompoints to alltopoints. The
    function proxistat() creates a proximity score that quantifies, for each spatial
    unit like a Census block group, how many topoints are nearby and how close
    they are.
