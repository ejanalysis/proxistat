Title: Create a proximity score for each Census unit, based on distances to nearby points of interest

Description: This package has functions helping to calculate distances between
  geographic points, such as the distances between all points, distances to
  all points within some maximum distance, distance to nearest single point,
  etc. It also can create a proximity score for each spatial unit like a
  Census block group, to quantify the distance-weighted count of nearby
  points. This proximity score can be used in environmental justice (EJ)
  analysis, for example. This package uses the sp package for the basic distance
  calculation. Key functions include get.nearest() to find the one topoint
  nearest each frompoint, get.distances() to find distances quickly within an
  optional search radius, and get.distances.all() to find distances from all
  frompoints to alltopoints. The function proxistat() creates a proximity
  score that quantifies, for each spatial unit like a Census block group, how
  many topoints are nearby and how close they are.
